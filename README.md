# Exercise React

Run the server with

```bash
yarn
yarn start
```

Or if you use npm

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Then run the client

```bash
cd client
yarn
yarn start
```

Or if you use npm

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

The server part of this system is already designed and exposes a set of REST endpoints via the `/api` route and a GraphQL endpoint.

The client has been setup to consume graphql if you chose to use that instead.
